Description: Offline Wikipedia Viewer
 Evopedia uses compressed dumps of Wikipedia for offline use
 especially on embedded devices.
 .
 The geographical data in the articles is used to display a map of these
 articles. This map automagically uses your saved tiles from maep or tangogps
 if you are offline and Openstreetmap tiles if you are online. The images on
 Wikipedia are not contained in the dump but if you are connected to the
 internet, they are nevertheless shown.
